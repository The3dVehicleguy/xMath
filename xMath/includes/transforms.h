		 * @brief Composes a transformation matrix from translation, rotation, and scale components.
		 *
		 * This function creates a 4x4 transformation matrix by combining individual TRS
		 * (Translate-Rotation-Scale) components. The resulting matrix can be used to
		 * transform vertices, vectors, and other geometric data in 3D space. The transformation
		 * order follows standard computer graphics conventions.
		 *
		 * The composition follows the mathematical order: M = T * R * S
		 * Where transformations are applied to vertices in the reverse order:
		 * 1. Scale is applied first (to the original object space)
		 * 2. Rotation is applied second (to the scaled object)
		 * 3. Translation is applied last (to position the rotated and scaled object)
		 *
		 * @param translation The translation vector representing the position offset in world space.
		 *                    Each component corresponds to movement along X, Y, and Z axes.
		 * @param rotation The rotation quaternion representing the orientation. Quaternions provide
		 *                 smooth interpolation and avoid gimbal lock issues compared to Euler angles.
		 * @param scale The scale vector representing scaling factors for each axis. A value of 1.0
		 *              means no scaling, values > 1.0 increase size, values < 1.0 decrease size.
		 *              Negative values can be used for mirroring/reflection.
		 *
		 * @return Mat4 The resulting 4x4 transformation matrix ready for use in rendering
		 *              pipelines, physics calculations, or further matrix operations.
		 *
		 * @note - This function uses GLM's optimized matrix operations for performance.
		 * @note - Non-uniform scaling (different scale values for X, Y, Z) is fully supported.
		 *
		 * @code
		 * Vec3 position(10.0f, 5.0f, 0.0f);           // 10 units right, 5 units up
		 * Quat rotation = Quat::EulerDegrees(0, 45, 0); // 45-degree  rotation around Y-axis
		 * Vec3 scale(2.0f, 1.0f, 2.0f);               // Twice as wide and deep, same height
		 *
		 * Mat4 objectTransform = ComposeTransform(position, rotation, scale);
		 * // Use objectTransform to position and orient an object in the scene
