     * @class Mat4
     * @brief A 4x4 matrix class for 3D transformations and mathematical operations.
     *
     * This class represents a 4x4 matrix commonly used in 3D graphics for transformations
     * such as translation, rotation, scaling, and projection. The matrix is stored in
     * row-major order and provides comprehensive mathematical operations and utility functions.
     *
     * The matrix layout is:
     * ```
     * [m00  m01  m02  m03]
     * [m10  m11  m12  m13]
     * [m20  m21  m22  m23]
     * [m30  m31  m32  m33]
     * ```
     *
     * For transformation matrices, the typical layout is:
     * - Upper-left 3x3: Rotation and scaling
     * - Fourth column (m03, m13, m23): Translation
     * - Fourth row (m30, m31, m32): Usually (0, 0, 0)
     * - Bottom-right (m33): Usually 1 for affine transformations
