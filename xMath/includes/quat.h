     * @brief A quaternion class for representing rotations in 3D space.
     *
     * Quaternions provide a compact and mathematically robust representation of rotations
     * that avoids gimbal lock and provides smooth interpolation. A quaternion is composed
     * of four components: x, y, z (vector part) and w (scalar part).
     *
     * The quaternion is stored as (x, y, z, w) where:
     * - (x, y, z) represents the rotation axis scaled by sin(θ/2)
     * - w represents cos(θ/2) where θ is the rotation angle
     *
     * This class provides comprehensive support for quaternion mathematics including:
     * - Construction from Euler angles, axis-angle, and vectors
     * - Conversion to/from matrices and Euler angles
     * - Interpolation methods (SLERP, LERP)
     * - Rotation composition and mathematical operations
     *
     * @note - Quaternions are expected to be normalized for proper rotation behavior.
     * @note - This implementation follows the convention where w is the scalar component.

         * This union allows accessing the quaternion components either as named
         * fields (x, y, z, w) or as an array (xyzw[4]). This provides flexibility
         * for different use cases and interfacing with APIs that expect arrays.
         *
         * Component Layout:
         * - x, y, z: The vector part of the quaternion (rotation axis * sin(θ/2))
         * - w: The scalar part of the quaternion (cos(θ/2))
         * - xyzw[]: Array access to all four components in order [x, y, z, w]
         *
         * @note - The components can be accessed either by name or by array index
         * @note - Array access follows the order: [0]=x, [1]=y, [2]=z, [3]=w
         *
